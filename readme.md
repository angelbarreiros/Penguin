Penguin is a modular backend helper library for Go, designed to accelerate backend development by providing robust, reusable components for routing, authentication, logging, scheduling, database access, and more.

- **Scheduler**: Lightweight cron-like job scheduler for background tasks.
- **Database Helper**: Pluggable database driver abstraction (PostgreSQL included), with connection pooling and scanning utilities.
- **Logger**: Structured logging to console and file, with log rotation and color support.
